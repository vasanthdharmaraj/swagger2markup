== Introduction

The primary goal of this project is to **simplify the generation of an up-to-date RESTful API documentation by combining documentation that's been hand-written with auto-generated API documentation** produced by https://github.com/swagger-api[Swagger]. The result is intended to be an **up-to-date, easy-to-read, on- and offline user guide**. The output of Swagger2Markup can be used as an alternative to https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui[swagger-ui] and can be served as static content.

NOTE: The Swagger Specification has been donated to to the https://openapis.org/[Open API Initiative (OAI)] and has been renamed to https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification[OpenAPI Specification].

Swagger2Markup converts a Swagger JSON or YAML specification into either **AsciiDoc**, **GitHub Flavored Markdown** or *Atlassian Confluence Wiki* documents which can be combined with hand-written Markup documentation. The Swagger source file can be located locally or remotely via HTTP. Internally Swagger2Markup uses the __official__ https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-parser[swagger-parser] and https://github.com/Swagger2Markup/markup-document-builder[markup-document-builder].

You can use Swagger2Markup to convert your contract-first Swagger YAML file into Markup. As an alternative, you can choose the code-first approach and use Swagger2Markup together with https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki/Swagger-Core-JAX-RS-Project-Setup-1.5.X[Swagger JAX-RS], https://github.com/springfox/springfox[Springfox] or https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-restdocs[spring-restdocs]. If you are are Gradle or Maven user, you can also use the https://github.com/Swagger2Markup/swagger2markup-gradle-plugin[Swagger2Markup Gradle Plugin] or https://github.com/redowl/swagger2markup-maven-plugin[Swagger2markup Maven Plugin].

NOTE: The project requires at least JDK 8.

===  AsciiDoc

http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[AsciiDoc] is preferable to Markdown as it has more features. AsciiDoc is a text document format for writing documentation, articles, books, ebooks, slideshows, web pages and blogs. AsciiDoc files can be converted to **HTML**, **PDF** and **EPUB**. AsciiDoc is much better suited for describing public APIs than **JavaDoc** or **Annotations**.

You can generate your HTML5, PDF and EPUB documentation via https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctorj[asciidoctorj] or even better via the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-gradle-plugin[asciidoctor-gradle-plugin] or https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-maven-plugin[asciidoctor-maven-plugin].
